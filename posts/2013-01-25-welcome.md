Welcome to my blog! I am Nikolaos Bezirgiannis, a Master student
interested in the theory and practice of functional programming. Currently,
I am occupied with finishing my MSc thesis, so for the time being, I will
mostly bother you with principles in parallel and distributed discrete-event simulation (PDES) and
their application to functional languages (mostly Haskell and Erlang). My ultimate goal is to document my
progress along the way, so as to make the writing of my thesis easier. Enjoy!
