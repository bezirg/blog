# Software contributions

I develop and maintain a transcompiler
from ABS to Haskell at <http://github.com/bezirg/abs2haskell>.
ABS is a high-level modeling language with functional
and OO characteristics. For more info check
the [homepage](http://abs-models.org) of the ABS language as well as the involved [European project](http://envisage-project.eu).
